Unfortunately when I did the project I was not that serious ,
and thus I don't have verilog codes (except the one without any comment in the slides).
\n
The details of the project my team was to design a verilog module to be deployed in the Basys 3 FPGA 
that would control the traffic flow on a crossing with one way highways.
\n
I lead my team for the verilog project.
\n
The traffic light contoller that we designed is able to operate in 3 modes ,
\n
Normal modes with automatic switching between green and red lights after 5 seconds.
\n
VIP mode : where the green lights stay on on the highway with VIP cars for 10 seconds and 
then after wards the traffic light controller system jumps to the normal mode again
\n
Test Mode: here the red lights stay on on both the highways ,until the system is made to go in the normal or vip modes
,this  mode is designed to use in night.
